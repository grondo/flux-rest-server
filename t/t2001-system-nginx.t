test_description='Test the nginx front end against a Flux system instance

Drives real HTTP through the nginx config shipped in
nginx/flux-rest-server-insecure.conf.example -- the same file the README tells
sites to start from -- so the example is parsed by nginx and exercised
end to end: Basic auth, the auth_request to the _ensure helper, and proxy_pass
to the authenticated user'\''s socket.

t2000 covers the same machinery over unix sockets, without nginx.  This file
touches only the accounts in $SYSTEM_TEST_USER_A/_B, and t2000 touches only
$USER, so the two share no systemd units and may run in parallel.

Requires the container built by src/test/docker/docker-run-system.sh.  Run with
`make check-system`; these tests are deliberately absent from TESTS.
